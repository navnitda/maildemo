      <h1> What We Do</h1>
      <p>We, at Whiteboard Consultants, believe new-age programs and up-skilling are the way forward in New India. Be it
        School
        going students, graduates or job seekers must be aware of Emerging Technologies. The New Education Policy (NEP
        2020)
        also gives much importance to building a Digital India. Hence, exposure to Emerging Technologies for School
        Students
        is the way forward and COE is being set up to facilitate this. Similarly, for Graduates/Job Seekers, there lies
        a huge
        opportunity in the field of Investment Banking for Finance Graduates. Students with Engineering Degrees and
        Graduates
        with Science, Economics, Mathematics, and Statistics careers as Data Analysts, Data Scientists, and
        Cybersecurity
        Specialists have good prospects. Students with a flair for Embedded Technologies can also build up a great
        career in
        their field by picking up the required industry-specific skill sets. Students who wish to make a career in
        Additive
        Manufacturing and designing are also not left behind. They can learn 3D printing and transform the way
        products
        are designed.<br>
        <br>
        A career in Sports also cannot be far behind. With the corporatisation of sports heralding the cricket leagues
        for
        Women and Men in the form of IPL, Football, with ISL has become more popular and does not remain a sport having
        a fan
        base only in a few states, but has become a national event. Kabaddi, Hockey are also not far behind in
        popularity. The
        Khelo India initiative has now brought sports into the lives of every student and the future of sports is only
        looking
        brighter in India. World is recognising Indian Athletes, Boxers, and Wrestlers today. Tennis, Badminton also are
        throwing big names in the world arena. The popularity and the corporatisation of sports have opened up newer
        careers
        for aspirants in the form of Sports Management, Coaching and Sports Science.<br><br>
